    <h1>About</h1>

    <p>Hi, my name is John Thomas, and thank you for taking the time to learn about my capstone project, which is focused
    on overnight lodging options related to outdoor recreation. Specifically, I focus on companies who work with property
    owners to rent out space on their land for overnight guests, that is camping options with a host. A number of companies
    are currently operating in this space:</p>

    <img src="/static/assets/logos.png" alt="Airbnb" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%; padding-bottom:10px;">

    <p>If you are one of these companies and you would like to add a new campsite to your website, the question then is
        how do you generate the content that will most strongly attract visitors when they come to this page.</p>

    <img src="/static/assets/contentex.png" alt="Airbnb" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;padding-bottom:10px;">

    <p>For the company, it would be labor intensive to research every potential campsite region in the country.
    You could put the hosts in charge of this, but without a hospitality background they may not know exactly what attracts visitors.
        In light of these contraints, I deliver zip-code-specific, auto-generated smart content with 4 main components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the identification of popular outdoor activities in a given region</li>
        <li>the campsite amenities that add the most value to guest stays</li>
        <li>projections for monthly/yearly traffic, and</li>
        <li>generated text descriptions of the campsite</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To do this, I leverage data made available by the federal government (<a href="https://ridb.recreation.gov/" target="_blank">RIDB</a>),
        where the datasource aggregates information
    from various forestry services from around the country who operate campsites.
    For these state-run campsites, the data present both location specific details (approx. 96K campsites over 3K facilities) and
        reservations made at these locations (approx. 20M reservations, 2006-2019).</p>

    <p>In particular, I use the reservation data to create a popularity score (ultimately, I used count of people) for each facility that has overnight stays.
        Against this score, utilizing Poisson and logistic regressions, I performed step forward feature selection to identify the activities and
    attributes that are most impactful.  For my visitor traffic, I used the historical data to establish baseline rates
        for the number of people who visit the area.  Finally, for the campsite descriptions, I aggregated campsite summaries provided
    in our dataset and used an extractive summarization to retain the key clauses.  Future work will take these building blocks and improve
    the human readability of the present results.</p>

    <p>The <a href="{{url_for('content') }}">end result</a> is smart content that, based on a user entering a zip code, collects information about the region,
    identifies the activities that are available and highlights those that the model labelled as important to attracting
        guests, summarizes the expected number of visitors throughout the year, and provides a text summary of nearby campsites.</p>
